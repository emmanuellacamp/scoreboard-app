# Scoreboard App

This is a simple scoreboard app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to keep track of scores for two teams (Home and Guest) and reset them if needed.

## Project Overview

This project was created as a solo project on Scrimba to practice basic web development skills, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Add scores for both the Home and Guest teams
- Increment scores by 1, 2, or 3 points with corresponding buttons
- Reset scores to zero with a reset button

## Usage

To use the scoreboard app:
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Development

This project consists of three main files:
- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure of the scoreboard app.
- `index.css`: Contains the CSS styles for the app's layout and design.
- `index.js`: Contains the JavaScript code for handling score updates and resets.
